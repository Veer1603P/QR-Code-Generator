## üöÄ How to Run

Follow these steps to get the QR Code Generator up and running on your local machine:

### 1\. Clone the Repository (Optional)

If you have this code in a repository, you'd typically clone it. If you just have the `app.py` file, you can skip this step.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### 2\. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3\. Activate the Virtual Environment

  * **Windows:**
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  * **macOS/Linux:**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 4\. Install Dependencies

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit qrcode Pillow
```

### 5\. Run the Streamlit App

Save the provided code as `app.py` (or any other `.py` file) and then run it using Streamlit:
